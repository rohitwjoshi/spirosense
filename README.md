# Spirosense
### Medical device diagnostic tool for respiratory conditions like COPD and asthma 

Spirosense was a 2 year project to help develop a low-cost and deskilled medical device to diagnose chronic respiratory conditions. The final prototype was less than a hundreth of the cost of typical devices on the market and functioned by plugging into a computer or tablet device via a 3.5 mm jack and conducting the signal processing there. The following repo contains some of the MATLAB files that helped run the signal processing and a "Pitch Deck" to fully explain the concept.
